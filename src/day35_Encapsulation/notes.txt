getter:
getter is a method. if it is a method it has the block of code.
if the user has modify the data;which method is modifying? or writing the data:SETTER
setter is for write only
what is benefit of the setter to modify the private data?
setter is a method. if it is a method; you can also give additional,conditional,requirements any
getter and setter more control of the private data. to read to write and access the data.
method can have private access modifier but it gives logical error(getter and setter)
because if those methods are ment to be read and write the private data outside the class those methods
has to be accessible at all the time otherwise those two method has no purpose
which access modifier can garanty that those two methods are accessible at all the time?--PUBLIC
fields means : instance variables
getter has return has private variable you must return private variables value
if this getter is a method? what's the return type? --NOT VOID. return type must match private instance variable
do we use getter for other purposes?--> WE ONLY USED FOR READ ONLY
does getter pass any parameters?-->NO.

setter:
it is a void method
without having the new data can the setter still be able to set the private instance variable?
--NO.seter it passes a parameter can it pass any parameter with any data type?--NO.
the parameter that you are passing in the setter==> the parameters data type has to be what? -- IT MUST
match with the private instance variables data type!!
setter you are only using it the changed it data.
this.name=name;
use the data: either reading it or writing
setter it reassigns the private instance variable to given argument
