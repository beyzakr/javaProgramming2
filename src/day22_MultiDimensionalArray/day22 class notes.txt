 try to analyze the code by yourself

each characters from the second word, use the index one of the array, I will pass the
index number (i), which can help me each of the characters in back words. You need to add
String variable reverse

in Interview reverse the second word, or reverse the last word only

all the arrays that you've been use before it is the single dimensional array
that is the used for containing the elements
if you just have one braced, that means elements so single dimensional array
multidimensional  array we only use it whenever we're trying the store multiple arrays
every single multidimensional array: "The N dimensional array is a container for(N-1) dimensional arrays"

Java Day22
Topic: Multi Dimensional Array
package name: day22_MultiDimensionalArray
warmup task:
1. Write a program that can reverse a sentence
Ex:
sentence = "Today is a good day to
learn Java";
output:
Java learn to day good a is Today
2. Write a program that can reverse the second word of the sentence
Ex:
sentence = "I Love Java";
output:
I evoL Java
Single Dimensional Array: container for the elemnts

int[] array = {10, 20, 30};
Multi Dimensional Array: container for the arrays
